// ThreadSafeStore is an interface that allows concurrent indexed
// access to a storage backend.  It is like Indexer but does not
// (necessarily) know how to extract the Store key from a given
// object.
//
// TL;DR caveats: you must not modify anything returned by Get or List as it will
// not being thread safe.
//
// The guarantees of thread safety provided by List/Get are only valid if the caller
// treats returned items as read-only. For example, a pointer inserted in the store
// through `Add` will be returned as is by `Get`. Multiple clients might invoke `Get`
// on the same key and modify the pointer in a non-thread-safe way. Also note that
// modifying objects stored by the indexers (if any) will *not* automatically lead
// to a re-index. So it's not a good idea to directly modify the objects returned by
// Get/List, in general.
